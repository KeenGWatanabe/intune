Excellent! You are very close, but I can spot a few critical issues that are causing your deployment to fail. The error you're seeing is likely because Intune is confused by the mismatch between what you uploaded and the commands you gave it.

Let's break down the problems:

### Critical Issue #1: Package File vs. Install Command Mismatch

This is your **main problem**.

*   **You uploaded:** `action1_agent(My_Organization).intunewin`
    *   This `.intunewin` file was created by wrapping the **`action1_agent(My_Organization).exe`** file (the one you downloaded from the Action1 portal).
*   **Your install command is:** `msiexec /i "action1_agent(My_organization).msi" /qn`
    *   This command tells Intune to look inside the package for an **`.msi`** file and install it.

**Intune is looking for the `.msi` file inside your `.intunewin` package, but it's not there. It only contains the `.exe` file.** This contradiction is causing the failure.

**Solution:**
You must use the correct install command for the **EXE** installer that Action1 provides. The typical silent install command for their EXE is:
**`action1_agent_(My_Organization).exe /S`**

Change your install command to this.

### Critical Issue #2: Detection Rule Path

Your detection rule is looking for:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Action1\action1.exe`

This is *probably* correct, but you should double-check. The safest way to be sure is to:
1.  Manually install the Agent on a test machine using your `action1_agent(My_Organization).exe` file.
2.  Once installed, open File Explorer and navigate to where it was actually installed. The path is *likely* correct, but it's best to confirm.

### Strong Recommendation: Fix the Uninstall Command

Your uninstall command uses a GUID: `msiexec /x "{D2A01132-A70B-407E-BEF7-FD4D58743149}" /qn`

This GUID is for an MSI-based install. Since you are using an EXE, this command will not work. The Action1 EXE installer likely also handles uninstallation.

**A better, more universal uninstall command is to use the file path:**
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Action1\uninst.exe /S
```
Or, if that doesn't exist, you might need to use:
```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Action1\action1.exe" /uninstall
```
**You need to check the Action1 documentation or test this on a machine with the agent installed to find the correct silent uninstall command.** The MSI-based command you have will fail.

### Summary of Changes to Make:

1.  **Install command:** Change from `msiexec /i ...` to **`action1_agent_(My_Organization).exe /S`**
2.  **Uninstall command:** Find and use the correct silent uninstall command for the EXE-based installer. (Test this on a machine with the agent installed).
3.  **Verify Detection Rule:** Confirm that `C:\Program Files (x86)\Action1\action1.exe` is the correct path after a manual install.

Once you make these changes, especially the first one, your app should upload and deploy successfully. You are using the right tool and process, you just have a small but critical mismatch in the file type and command.
